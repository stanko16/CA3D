<h3>Cellular Automata in 3D.</h3>
Simple cellular automation in 3D created using Processing and the PeasyCam library.<br>
To use the compiled applications, press the folowing keys to manage the iterations:<br>
- [p] --> Pause (stop iterations)
- [g] --> Go (start iterations)
- [s] --> Step (do one iteration, then stop)
- [r] --> Reset (start from the begining)
- [1..9] --> Change number of neighbors with whom to interact
- [+] --> Increase frame rate (increase iterations speed)
- [-] --> Decrease frame rate (decrease iterations speed)
