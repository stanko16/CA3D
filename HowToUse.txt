Cellular Automata in 3D.

Simple cellular automation in 3D created using Processing and the PeasyCam library.
To use the compiled applications, press the folowing keys to manage the iterations:

    [p] --> Pause (stop iterations)
    [g] --> Go (start iterations)
    [s] --> Step (do one iteration, then stop)
    [r] --> Reset (start from the begining)
    [1..9] --> Change number of neighbors with whom to interact
    [+] --> Increase frame rate (increase iterations speed)
    [-] --> Decrease frame rate (decrease iterations speed)
